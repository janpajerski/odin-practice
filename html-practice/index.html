        <h1>Hello World.</h1>
        
        <p>I'm really excited to be using the <strong>The Odin Project</strong> to finally learn programming. This is for real. I've started and stopped learning to code many times. No more. I'm really going to do it.</p>
        
        <h2>What and I going to do differently?</h2>
        
        <p>This time around I will apply the slow and steady approach. <em>I will work on programming everyday, for a minimum set time, then focus on other things like my job, my family, excesise, etc.</em> Now let's get into these in more detail</p>

        <h3>Slow and Steady</h3>
